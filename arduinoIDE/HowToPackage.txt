There are now scripts for automatically packaging the latest EFM32 source for the ArdunioIDE. 

First thing is to make sure any changes needed for the tools are included in the tools directory before running the buildEngmusingLibrary.sh script. 
If there are not any tools changes then the BUILD_TOOLS variable can be set to 0 in the buildEngmusingLibrary.sh script.

Next make sure the VERSION and TOOLS_VERSION variables are correct for what you want to build. 

Once that is all verified then buildEngimusingLibrary.sh can be run.

After it has been run then the modified json and tar files can be checked in using GIT and the ardunio IDE will find the new tars.
You can also test out the json files using the test directories if you want to be sure they work before making them live to the world.
